# KODI-KEY
An ESP32-based Bluetooth-Remote for KODI

This is an ESP32-Code, ready to be compiled inside the ArduinoIDE.
You need to set Arduino-IDE to use your ESP32-module. I am using cheap ESP32-WROOM32-Modules with 38Pins.

You need the ESP-module and 16 Push-Buttons. Additionally you may use  LED and a 300Ohm-resistor. This LED shows how near the Deepsleep-mode is.
For creating a BLE-keyboard, you need the BLE-Keyboard-Library installed to your ArduinoIDE.
